            <h2 className="mtm bold-4">Do I need to apply?</h2>
            <p>
              No, you do not need to apply.
            </p>


            <h2 className="mtm bold-4">What are the prerequisites?</h2>
            <p>
              The course is composed of 5 lessons, delivered entirely over email, over a period of
              five calendar weeks after the enrollment cycle commences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typically, each lesson will be delivered to your inbox on Tuesdays. You can then
              book appointment slots for the the following weekend, to access one-on-one coaching and feedback.
            </p>



            <h2 className="mtm bold-4">What is the course structure?</h2>
            <p>
              In order to be successful in this course, we recommend that you have a comfortable
              working knowledge of Business, and are educated to at least Degree level.
            </p>
            <p className="vmm">
              You do not require a prior knowledge of pure computing or technology
              terms specifically, although knowing these would help.
            </p>



            <h2 className="mtm bold-4">Can I start the course at any time?</h2>
            <p>
              No. Typically, we have cycles of enrollment running at different times of the year,
              when a batch of people can take the course. All cycles have the exact same content,
              but batching it allows to manage and deliver a better experience for all.
            </p>
            <p className="vmm">
              The next one starts on August 7th 2018. In the meantime, you can enroll and pay to secure
              your place ahead of time. Once the cycle starts, you will begin receiving the lessons in your inbox.
            </p>


            <h2 className="mtm bold-4">Who can I reach if I have issues with enrolling or payment?</h2>
